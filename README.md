### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer based in New York working on [Avenue](https://avenue.so).

I used to work at [Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/science/) in Cambridge, MA, where I built software for the Alexa AI team focused on low-latency entity resolution.

Prior to that, I went to school at UPenn as part of the Jerome Fisher Management & Technology program. My favorite classes were [Internet & Web Systems](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis455/) and [Negotiations](https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/2015C/LGST206409/).

I grew up in New York and Geneva, Switzerland. I have fond memories of both places.
